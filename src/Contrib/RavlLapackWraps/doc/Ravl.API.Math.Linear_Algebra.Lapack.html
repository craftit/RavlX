    <title>Lapack, Fast Linear Algebra Routines</title>
  </head>
  <body>
     <p>Lapack is an external fortran library which provides an efficient 
     implementation of many linear algebra routines.  To use these routines
     you will need to install the Lapack run-time libraries.</p>
     
     <p>Whilst the following functions allow you to explicity call the 
     Lapack routines, it should be noted that if you link the RavlLapack 
     library against any of your executables then the Lapack routine 
     may automatically be used to compute instead of using the normal Ravl one. </p>
     
     <p>The exception to this is the Matrix Inverse function as the standard
     Ravl implementation returns the determinant of the matrix, as well as the
     inverse.  The Lapack routine does not. For now, I have not added the hook
     which calls the Lapack routine as this could break code.</p>
     
     <p>The Lapack does offer increased computation performance, especially 
     on larger matrices.  However, a <b>much</b> bigger benefit can be obtained by
     linking your executables against the IntelMKL libraries.</p>
