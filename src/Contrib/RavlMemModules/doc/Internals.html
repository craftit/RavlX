    <h2>Module locking</h2>


    <p>Most modules require input data from other modules.  If Module 1
    requires input from Module 2, it first of all constructs an "access" to
    it.  There are 3 possible states that Module 2 could be in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>uninitialised</b>, in which case constructing the access will
      cause module 2 to be launched and run;</li>
      <li><b>already running</b>, because another module (or possibly the
      main program) has already caused it to be launched;</li>
      <li><b>finished</b>, i.e. finished running or finished loading from file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The important distinction is between the uninitialised state and the
    others, because if Module 2 is uninitialised, Module 1 will launch it, and
    not otherwise.  The situation to be avoided is for a module to be launched
    twice because two other modules access it simultaneously, both finding it
    uninitialised.  The module body has a variable <code>state</code> that
    prevents this happening; it therefore needs locking when being accessed.
    An example of its operation is <a
    href="../../../Images/Memory.pdf">here</a>. </p>

    <h2>Memory</h2>

    <p>The output of a module is stored in its memory unit, as a series either
    of XML strings or image files.  Currently the XML output is stored both in
    program memory and in an XML file, one file per module.  For the program
    memory version, there is an optional mechanism for "forgetting" results
    that are no longer needed by other modules, to reduce memory leakage.  The
    program memory version is accessed by other modules in the same program
    execution; the file version can be accessed by other modules in subsequent
    program execution. </p>
