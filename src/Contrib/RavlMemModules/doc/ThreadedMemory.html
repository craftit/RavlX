    <title>A framework for developing coarse-grained multi-threaded applications</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>These classes provide a framework for creating a coarse-grained
    multi-threaded modular application, designed with video / multimedia
    processing applications in mind. </p>

    <p> The set of modules are connected as an acyclic graph, to create a
    data-flow system, in which each module can read a synchronised stream of
    time-coded data from one or more previous modules and also creates
    time-coded data for any number of other modules.  Because the module graph
    is currently required to be acyclic, it is restricted to applications in
    which the data flow is unidirectional, i.e. there is no feedback. See <a
    href="../../../Images/ModuleGraph.pdf">here</a> for an illustration of the
    graph for a tennis analysis application.</p>


    <p> Each module provides: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>storage for the processing results, in XML or image form</li>
      <li>access to the storage of other modules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some other features of the system:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user's application specifies a target module (or modules), which
      the system then starts.  The system then automatically assembles itself,
      by recursively finding which modules are required to provide input and
      then starting them.</li>
      <li>Each module runs as a separate thread.</li>
      <li>Each module can write diagnostic information to its own window.</li>
      <li>Each module can also display its current contents in a dynamic dvi
      display.</li>
      <li>The module data is mainly stored as a series of XML elements, tagged
      with timecode information.  For efficiency reasons, any image data is
      stored as a separate binary file, referenced by the XML. </li>
      <li>Each module keeps track of what other modules are reading from it,
      and can optionally "forget" information that is no longer needed.</li>
      <li>The memory created by a session can be saved, and can then be used
      by a subsequent session.  This avoids the need to recompute modules
      early in the data processing network when diagnosing problems in later
      modules. </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Components of the system</h2>


    <h3>The module manager</h3>

    <p>The module manager acts as a container for the modules.  This class <a
    href="../Class/MemModulesC.html"><code>MemModulesC</code></a> has just one
    global instantiation as <code>ModuleManager</code>.  It handles global
    operations such as launching the target modules and waiting for the
    ensemble of modules to terminate.</p>

    <h3>The modules</h3>

    <p>The module base class is <a
    href="../Class/MemModuleC.html"><code>MemModuleC</code></a>.  This base
    class handles common operations such as launching that module, interfacing
    to the memory for the module output data, and reporting on the module
    status.  <code>MemModuleC</code> is a large RAVL object.  The
    corresponding abstract body base class, <a
    href="../Class/MemModuleBodyC.html"><code>MemModuleBodyC</code></a>, has a
    pure virtual member function <code>MemModuleBodyC::Run()</code> that each
    module must overload with a member function that implements that module's
    functionality. </p>

    <p>Each application module is itself a unique pair of handle and body
    classes that inherit <code>MemModuleC</code> and
    <code>MemModuleBodyC</code> respectively.  These classes are generated via
    a macro apart from the overloading of <code>MemModuleBodyC::Run()</code>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="MODULE">Creating a new application</a></h2>

    <p>To implement an application, the following application-specific code is
    needed: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>a <a href=
      "Ravl.API.OS.Multithreading_Framework.Modules_Header.html">header
      file</a> that declares the modules;</li>

      <li>a set of <a href=
      "Ravl.API.OS.Multithreading_Framework.Application_Module.html"> module
      member functions</a> derived from <code>MemModuleBodyC::Run()</code>
      that do the required processing, one per module;</li>

      <li>a <a href=
      "Ravl.API.OS.Multithreading_Framework.Main_Program.html#SETUP">code
      fragment</a> that instantiates the modules and runs the system.</li>

    </ul>
