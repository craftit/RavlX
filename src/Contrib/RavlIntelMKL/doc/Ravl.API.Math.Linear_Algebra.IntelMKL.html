    <title>IntelMKL, Extremely fast Linear Algebra routines</title>
  </head>
  <body>
     <p>IntelMKL is an external library which provides an extremely efficient 
     implementation of many linear algebra routines.  Intel have spent lots
     of effort in parellelising the routines and they can be 100's of times faster
     than the standard Ravl routines, especially on large matrices.  To use these 
     routines you will need to install IntelMKL which is downloadable from the Intel web-site</p>
     
     <p>Whilst the following routines allow you to explicity call the 
     IntelMKL routines, if you link the RavlIntelMKL library against any of your
     executables then the equivalent IntelMKL routine may automatically be called to compute
     the Inverse/EigenValues/SVD instead of using some of the normal Ravl functions.  
     This is done via a series of hooks.</p>
     
     <p>Note, the Inverse function does not return the actual determinant and is
     set to -1.0.  This is because the IntelMKL use Lapack routines and the determinant
     is not returned from the Lapack library.</p>
