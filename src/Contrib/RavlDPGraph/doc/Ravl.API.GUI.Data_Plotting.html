    <p>Requires library <code>RavlDPGraph</code></p>
    <hr>
    <p>This library allows the IO mechanism to 'save' data to the display as a graph.  The string "@GRAPH" is used in place of a file name.</p> 

    <p>To save individual images to the display, see <a href="../../../examples/exDPGraphWindow.cc">this example</a>.</p>

    <p>It can also be used to display a sequence of graphs via the RAVL streaming mechanism.  Thus if you want to output a series of graphs to the display, the constructor might be invoked as:</p>
<pre>
  DPOPortC<Array1dC<RealT> > outp;
  if(!OpenOSequence(outp,"@GRAPH")) {
    cerr << "Failed to open output '" << ofn << "'\n";
    return 1;
  }
</pre>
    <p>To give the window a label "Graphs", invoke it like this:</p>
    <pre>  if(!OpenOSequence(outp,"@X:Graphs")) {
</pre>

<p>  Normally repeated saves to the same window will replace its contents, if you want to accumulate the results of processing in a window you can use <B>@GRAPHA</B>.
