    <p>Class wizard is program designed to help with writing and maintaining Ravl style 'big objects'.  You write the body class, exactly as it should eventually be:
</p>    <ul>
      <li><pre>#include "Ravl/RefCounter.hh"</pre></li>
      <li>with class name ending <code>...BodyC</code></li>
      <li>with an entry under <code>HEADERS</code> in the <code>defs.mk</code> file</li>
      <li>with public inheritance of RCBodyC </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you run <code>cwiz</code> (with no options) it will add the handle class to all appropriately-formatted body classes that it finds, in that directory and any nested directories.  </p>

    <p><a href="../../../html/CwizExample.hh">Download this example</a> and try it yourself.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
      <li>By default, the header file is overwritten.  Use the "<code>-p</code>" option to specify a different o/p file.  Use "<code>-p -</code>" to write o/p to the terminal.</li>
<li> Uses the public part of the body class as reference to maintain the handle class.</li>
<li> Modifies existing header files, no need for seperate header compilation stage. </li>
      <li>Updates existing handle classes when additions are made to body classes.</li>
<li> Works around any modifications made by the author.</li>
<li> All methods and classes that are added are marked with '//!author:cwiz'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Operations:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Create handle a method for each public body method. 
<li> Create handle constructors for each public constructor in the body class.
<li> If no handle class is found, creates the handle class and places it after the body class.
<li> Remove handle methods and constructors for which there are no body methods. (Only methods marked with '//!author:cwiz')
<li> Optionally will create stub functions for the .cc file with '-s' option.
</ul>
