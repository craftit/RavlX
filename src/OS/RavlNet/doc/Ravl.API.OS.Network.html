    There are currently 3 levels of networking support in RAVL:
    <h3>Low level</h3>
    
    SocketC - This class provides low level socket operations associated TCP/IP and DNS networking. It hides the platform specific implementation details.
    
    <h3>Medium Level</h3>
    
    <p>NetIStreamC &amp; NetOStreamC - These allow a network stream to treated much like a file. You can use these to send data across a connection as text with the standard C++ '>>' and '<<' stream operators or with BinIStreamC and BinOStreamC as machine-independent binary.</p>

    <p>Equivalently, you can open an IStreamC or OStreamC using the "@NET" virtual file name:  <code>@NET:trinity.ee.surrey.ac.uk:4345</code></p>

    <p>NetEndPointC - Provides a mechanism for calling methods of a class across the network.</p>
    
    <h3> High level </h3>
    
    <a href="Ravl.API.OS.Network.NetPort.html">NetPort</a> - This class allows streams of data to exported across the network.  E.g. this can be used for transporting the results of image processing, or the raw images from a grabber card.
