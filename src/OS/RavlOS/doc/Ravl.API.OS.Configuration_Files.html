    <h2> The basics </h2>
    ConfigFileC reads configuration files in a format similar to that
    used by make. In its simplest form a files consists of a number of
    lines of the form '(variable) = (value)'. Comments start with '#',
    every thing between the '#' and the new line is ignored. Variable
    names are case sensitive and must not contain spaces or
    punctuation other than an underscore '_'. The value is taken as
    the first non space character after the '=' sign until the end of
    the line. Lines may be continued with a backslash '\'.  Values may
    be enclosed with double quotes, special characters (such as '#'
    and '\n') will not be interpreted inside the quoted text. If you
    wish to include quotes in your text the can be escaped with '\'
    and backslashes with '\\'. <p>
      
    Typically a configuration file would contain something like the following:<p>

    <hr>
    <code>
      # My program setup. <br>
      Threshold = 1.2     <br>
      MaxRegions = 4  # Typically set to 3.    <br>
      InputFile = "windmill.cif" <br>
    </code>
    <hr><p>
    
    The 'ConfigFileC' class deals entirely with strings.  If you ask
    for an undefined variable an empty string is given.  The code to
    read and process this file would look something like: <p>
    
    <code>
      ConfigFileC cfg("setup.conf"); <br>
      RealT threshold = cfg["Threshold"].RealValue(); <br>
      StringC filename = cfg["InputFile"]; <br>
      IntT maxRegions = cfg["MaxRegions"].IntValue(); <br>
    </code>
      
    <h2> Sections </h2>
    
    The following examples shows how to declare a section in your
    config file. The contents of a section are exactly as before, and
    may be defined recursively. <p>
    
    <hr>
    <code>
      Filter1 { <br>
      &nbsp; Gamma = 1.2 <br>
      &nbsp; Alpha = 0.4 <br>
      }
    </code>
    <hr><p>

    You can access sections with the 'Section(..)' method. If the section
    exists it will return the a ConfigFileC which can then be used to
    access the configuration information it contains. <p>
      
    <code>
      ConfigFileC cfg("setup.conf"); <br>
      ConfigFileC cfg_filt1 = cfg.Section("Filter1"); <br>
      if(cfg_filt1.IsValid()) { // Check that section has been found. <br>
      &nbsp; RealT gamma = cfg_filt1["Gamma"].RealValue(); <br>
      &nbsp; RealT alpha = cfg_filt1["Alpha"].RealValue(); <br>
      }
    </code>
