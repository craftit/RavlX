    <h3>What are signals ? </h3>
    
    A Signal is essentially a list of functions to call on an
    event. Signals currently may have 0, 1, 2 or 3 parameters which
    will be passed to the functions in the list.  The advantage of
    using signals over simple function pointers is that the exact form
    of the arguments or number of functions need not be known by the
    provider of the signal.  They are simpler to use than virtual
    functions as no new class needs be defined.

    <p>
      A useful feature of the signal implementation is that two
      signal structures can be connected together <b>without</b>
      creating a reference counted dependence between them. If either
      of the signal structures is destroyed the connection between
      them is automatically broken.  
    <p>
      If you are in a situation where you only want to call 1
      function, but still want flexibility in the exact form of that
      function it's worth looking at the <a href="Ravl.API.Core.Calls.html">Calls and Triggers</a> 
      in the RAVL core.

    <h4>Notes on RAVL's signal implementation </h4>
      
    The RAVL signal system has been inspired by <a
    href="http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/">libsigc++</a>, but written
    to work with RAVL style reference counting.
    
    <p>
      Features:
    <ul>
      <li> Signal objects are reference counted.
      <li> Adding and removing connections is thread safe.
      <li> The default implementation makes copies of the objects the
	signal will be delivered to, enabling it to call methods of
	reference counted objects safely.
    </ul>
      
    <h3>How to use them. </h3>
    
    The following code fragments are from the example code for 
    <a href="../Class/RavlN.Signal1C.html">Signal1C</a>. The complete
    example is <a href="../../Examples/exSignal1.cc.html">here</a>.
    <p>
      The signal code is part of the threads library so you have to
      add <b>RavlThreads</b> to your <a
      href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#USESLIBS">USESLIBS line</a> in
      defs.mk.  We're going to use signals with 1 parameter so we
      include the Signal1 header file.
    <pre>
#include "Ravl/Threads/Signal1.hh"
    </pre>
    <p>
      Creating a signal is simple, just declare it as a variable with
      an appropriate default value. The following code creates an
      integer signal with a default value of 0.
    <pre>
Signal1C<IntT> sig(0);
    </pre>

    <h4>Calling global functions. </h4>
    
    Suppose we have a function `PrintNumberA' we wish to be called
    when the signal is triggered. Note, the arguments of methods must
    always be non-const references to a type, and the functions should
    always return a bool. This significantly simplifies the
    implementation as it avoids implementing code for all possible
    combinations argument types and return types.
    
<pre>
bool PrintNumberA(int &amp;i) {
  cout << "PrintNumberA called with value " << i << "\n";
  return true;
}
</pre>

    This can be connected to the signal with the <b>Connect(..)</b> command.

<pre>
Connect(sig, &amp;PrintNumberA);
</pre>
    
    Similarly if you wish to connect a second signal to this you again
    call <b>Connect(...)</b>.
    
<pre>
Signal1C<IntT> sig2(1);

Connect(sig, sig2);
</pre>

    Finally to send a signal you use the () operator on the signal
    itself. If you omit a parameter the default value you initialise it
    with will be used instead. Calling the following:

<pre>
sig2(3); // Send the signal with a value of 3.
</pre>

    Prints the message
<pre>
PrintNumberA called with value 3
</pre>

    The arguments of the function do <b>not</b> have to match the
    signal you are calling. If the function takes more parameters than
    you are using you can supply the values when you call connect. To connect
    the following function `PrintNumber2':
    
<pre>
bool PrintNumber2(int &amp;i,RealT &v2) {
  cout << "PrintNumber2 called with value " << i << " v2=" << v2 << "\n";
  return true;
}
</pre>
    
    you supply the extra parameter at the end of the connect command, like this:

<pre>
Connect(sig, &amp;PrintNumber2,0,0.1);
</pre>
    
    Note: you have to supply values for all arguments of the function
    even where they are provided by the signal. When the signal is triggered
    it will call `PrintNumber2' with the the first parameter from the signal
    and the second set to a real value of 0.1.
    
    <h4>Calling class methods. </h4>
    
    Calling class methods is a little more complicated. You have to
    tell the system which instance of the class to call the method on. 
    
    Suppose you had the following class:
    
<pre>
class MyClassC {
public:
   bool Print(int &amp;i) {
     cout << "Value=" << i << "\n";
   }
};
</pre>    
    
    There are two ways to connect to a method you can either connect
    to a copy of the object (essential for reference counted objects.)
    or to a reference to it.  If you use a reference it is the programmers
    responsibility to ensure the object is valid when a signal is called.
    <p>
      To connect with a copy you would call <b>Connect</b> as follows:

<pre>
MyClassC xyz;

Connect(sig,xyz,&amp;MyClassC::Print);
</pre>
    <p>
      To connect with a reference you would use:
<pre>
MyClassC xyz;

ConnectRef(sig,xyz,&amp;MyClassC::Print);
</pre>
    
    Note: There are some potential race conditions in multi-threaded
    applications if you use the reference method of connecting to
    classes.  It is possible that the class processing a signal is
    destroyed before the call is complete with unpredictable results.
    This is guaranteed not to happen with the reference counted calls,
    the signal mechanism ensures a reference is kept to the object
    until all calls are complete.
