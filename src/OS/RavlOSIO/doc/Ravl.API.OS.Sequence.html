    <p>
      Sequences or streams (not to be confused with c++ streams) of
      objects are accessed in RAVL with two classes <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPIPortC.html">DPIPortC&lt;&gt; </a> and <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPOPortC.html">DPOPortC&lt;&gt;
      </a>. DPIPortC allows sequences of objects to be read in to a
      program and DPOPortC is used for writing them out.  You can
      initialise streams with the <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenISequenceObDPIPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenISequence</a>
      and <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenOSequenceObDPOPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenOSequence</a>
      respectively.  (See the <a href="Ravl.API.Core.Data_Processing.html">data flow programming</a> library for more details.)</p>
    <p>
      A typical example of where this kind of IO is used is the processing of video
      sequences <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Video.html">Ravl.API.Images.Video</a>.</p>
    <p>
      Following is a example of how to use these classes for reading
      and writing a sequence of integers.</p>
    <p>
      Before you can do anything you need to include the following header:</p>
    <pre>
      #include "Ravl/DP/SequenceIO.hh"
    </pre>
    
    You also have to include the appropriate library for handling the
    sequences you wish to use. e.g. For video IO you needs to add
    <b>RavlVideoIO</b> to your <a
    href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#USESLIBS">USESLIBS line in the
    defs.mk.</a>
    
    <h3> Reading a sequence </h3>
    
    <pre>
    DPIPortC&lt;int&gt; in;
    if(!OpenISequence(in,"myfile.abs")) {
      // Failed to open input file.
      // Report an error...
    }
    int value;
    while(in.Get(value)) {
      // Process your data...
    }
    </pre>
    
    <h3> Writting a sequence </h3>
    <pre>
    DPOPortC&lt;int&gt; out;
    if(!OpenOSequence(out,"myfile.abs")) {
      // Failed to open output file.
      // Report an error..
    }
    for(int i = 0;i < 10;i++)
       out.Put(i); // Write some data.
    </pre>
    <h2> Numbered files </h2> 

    It is possible to open a series of numbered files as a
    sequence. This can be done in several ways, by opening the first
    file in the sequence, by open with a filename containing %d in
    place of the number or if the number is before the extension by
    omitting the number entirely. See the sub-section <a
    href="Ravl.API.OS.Sequence.Numbered_Files.html"> Numbered files</a>
    for more details.
    
    <h2> Type conversion </h2> 
    <p>
      The same system of type conversion is used for streams as for
      the loading and saving of single objects.  For more details on
      how this works and how to implement type converters see <a
      href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.html">Ravl.API.Core.IO</a>.</p>
    
    <h2> Seekable streams </h2> 
    <p>
      Often you want both information about where in the stream you
      are, and control over the position from which your going to read
      or write data. This can be done with seekable streams <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPISPortC.html">DPISPortC&lt;&gt; </a> and
      <a href="../Class/RavlN.DPOSPortC.html">DPOSPortC&lt;&gt;
      </a>. They can be used and initalised in the same way as
      DPIPortC and DPOPortC seen previously with <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenISequenceObDPISPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenISequence</a>
      and <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.OpenOSequenceObDPOSPortCLtDataTGt_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_const_StringC_Amp_boolCb.html">OpenOSequence</a>.</p>
    <p>
      These classes have an additional set of member functions which
      allow control of the position in the stream. A description of
      these functions can be found in <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.DPSeekCtrlC.html">DPSeekCtrlC</a>.  Note: not
      all streams support all these methods, if a sequence doesn't
      support a method your using it will report a failure. It is
      possible to open any sequence in RAVL as a seekable stream,
      though the seek controls will have no effect.

    <h2>Hints on writing your own sequence I/O</h2>

    <p>
      Typically this will onsist of at least 2 sets of files, something along the lines of <code>xxFormat.hh/cc</code> and<code> xxxIOxx.hh/cc</code>.</p>

    <h3><code>xxFormat.hh/cc</code>:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>handle/body classes that inherit FileFormatBodyC and FileFormatC respectively
      </li>
      <li>contains stuff to provide info about the automatic selection of file handler appropriate to the file type - <code>ProbeLoad/ProbeSave</code> etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><code>xxxIOxx.hh/cc</code>:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>to do with actually reading / writing the files</li>
      <li>Maybe base class that includes anything common to reading and
        writing (no required inheritance)</li>
      <li>Derived handle/body classes that inherit the base class and also
        <code>DPI/O[S]PortBodyC</code> and <code>DPI/O[S]PortC</code> -
        <code>Get / Put</code> etc.</li>
    </ul>
