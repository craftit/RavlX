    <title>Sequences of numbered files</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>There are three ways of opening a numbered sequence of files: by
    opening the first file in the sequence; by opening with a filename
    containing %d in place of the number; or (if the number is before
    the extension) by omitting the number entirely.</p>
    
    <h3> Using <code>%d</code> in the filename.  </h3>

    <p>Using <code>%d</code> you can explicitly set the format of the
    file name to be used. It is used by placing the <code>%d</code> in
    the filename where the number is expected. <code>name%d.xxx</code>
    can be used to read or write a sequence of files such as:</p>
      
    <pre>name1.xxx name2.xxx name3.xxx</pre> 
    
    <p>If you wish the filenames to be zero padded you can add the
    number of digits between the <code>%</code> and the
    <code>d</code>. So <code>name%3d.xxx</code> can be used to write
    (or read) the following files:</p>
      
    <pre>name001.xxx name002.xxx name003.xxx</pre> 
          
    <h3> Using the name of the first file in the sequence. </h3> 
      
    <p>You can use the name of the first file in the sequence,
    provided that this file cannot be interpreted as a stream
    itself (such as pnm) you can just open the first file in the
    sequence and the rest of the sequence will be found
    automatically. So you could open the following sequence:</p>

    <pre>name001.xxx name002.xxx name003.xxx</pre> 
    
    <p>with the filename <code>name001.xxx</code>.</p>
      
    <h3>Omitting the number completely. </h3> 
      
    <p>If the filename is in the form <code>nameNNN.XXX</code>, where
    <code>NNN</code> is some number and <code>XXX</code> is the
    extension (i.e. the number immediately precedes the extension),
    the file may be opened as <code>name.XXX</code> (provided that no
    file of that name exists). The system will scan the directory for
    files which conform to this format.  It will then work out the
    range of digits and also whether zero padding is being used.</p>
