    <title>XML Streams</title>

    <p> These classes are intended to provide <b>basic</b> XML stream
    handing. </p>

    <p> There are two separate approaches: </p> 

    <ul> 
      <li>tree-based, similar to the W3C <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a>.  The
      advantage of the tree approach is that the whole document is
      read into a tree whose structure is identical to the XML in the
      document that is being read or written.  The tree can be added
      to or pruned to reflect changes in the document.  Use <a
      href="../Class/RavlN.XMLTreeC.html">XMLTreeC</a> for this
      approach. </li>

      <li>A stream-based method more like <a
      href="http://www.saxproject.org/">SAX</a> (Simple API for XML).  The
      advantage of this approach is that the document does not have to be
      stored in its entirety.  Use the remaining classes (apart from XMLTreeC)
      and functions below for this approach.  The following enum (not
      otherwise in the documentation) might be useful:

        <pre>enum XMLTagOpsT {
    XMLEndTag, XMLContent, XMLIndent, XMLIndentDown, XMLBeginTag, 
    XMLEmptyTag, XMLComment, XML_PI
}; <pre>  
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> The classes and functions allow RAVL programs to read and
    write XML files without including 3rd party libraries. If you want
    to do any operations involving DTD's it is suggested you look at
    one of the many existing libraries that can be found on the web.
    If there is demand for this functionality a RAVL wrapper class for
    one of these libraries may well be added to the RAVL Contrib code
    base.</p>
