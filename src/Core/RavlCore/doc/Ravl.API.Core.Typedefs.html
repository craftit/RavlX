    <p>There are a few typedefs commonly used in RAVL code. These make
    it easier to port code transparently between different platforms
    as it allows you to make assumptions about types you can't make
    about the standard 'C' types.  E.g. in RAVL, IntT is guaranteed to
    always be at least a 32-bit integer. 

    <p> Most of them are defined <a href="../Class/RavlN.html#IntT">here</a>.
    However, due to problems with the way the documentation system handles
    multiple platforms, you might prefer to use the corresponding <a
    href="../../../../../../include/Ravl/Types.hh">header file</a>. </p>
    
    <p>It's also worth noting the <a href= "../Class/RavlN.IndexC.html">
    IndexC</a> class: this has been introduced as an alternative efficient
    signed integer of at least 32 bits, as a work around for the many problems
    that can arise from C's rounding and sign conversion rules. </p>
