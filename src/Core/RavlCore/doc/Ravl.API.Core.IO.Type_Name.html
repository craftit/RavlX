    Unfortunately the C++ standard does not specify what string is
    returned from the <code>type_info.name()</code> function.  This means if you
    wish to use files containing with code generated by different
    compilers you'll get inconsistent results.  These functions are
    here to help get around the problem. The preferred format is the
    c++ type name with all spaces removed.
