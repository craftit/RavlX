  <body>
    <p>These functions and classes provide a flexible method for handling
    function and method pointers, while simplifying the syntax. They have many
    of the advantages of using <a href="Ravl.API.OS.Signals.html">Signals</a> in
    that you don't have to know the exact form of a function pointer, but
    without the complexity.  The rough breakdown of the following classes and
    functions is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>Call...</code> classes below provide the basic mechanism
      for setting up and triggering calls to functions and methods.</li>

      <li> The <code>Trigger()</code> functions are "helper" functions to make
      it simple to create <code>Call...</code> and <code>TriggerC</code>
      objects.  The arguments to these functions might seem obscure, but in
      practice they are designed so that you can substitute more or less any
      argument type: const or no-const, by name or by reference, etc. </li>

      <li> The <code>TriggerC</code> class is the parent class for all of the
      <code>Call...</code> classes: thus it can be assigned to from any of the
      <code>Trigger()</code> helper functions (see example below).  It is
      useful if you don't need arguments or return values at the point of
      invoking the call.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Using triggers </h3>
    
    Triggers are the simplest form of call. They allow a function
    with an arbitrary set of parameters to be called on an event. It is
    used for example in classes such as 
    <a href="../Class/RavlN.TimedTriggerQueueC.html">TimedTriggerQueueC</a>
    to call a method after a fixed delay, and in 
    <a href="../Class/RavlN.TickerTriggerC.html">TickerTriggerC</a> which
    calls a method repeatedly at a fixed frequency.
    <p>
      Creating a trigger is simple:
<pre>
#include "Ravl/Trigger.hh"

TriggerC myTrigger;
</pre>
    
    You can assign a function to it using the <b>Trigger</b> call.

<pre>
bool PrintNumber(int &amp;i) {
  cout << "PrintNumber called with value " << i << "\n";
  return true;
}

myTrigger = Trigger(&amp;PrintNumber,2);
</pre>
    
    <p>Calling the function can be done with the () operator:</p>
    
<pre>
myTrigger();
</pre>

    <p>If the function is a member function of a reference-counted class
    (i.e. of the handle to a class), use TriggerR instead.</p>

    <p>The difference in functionality of <code>Trigger</code> and
    <code>TriggerR</code> is this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>Trigger</code> will make a copy of the object or, if the
      object is a reference-counted object, increment the reference
      counter.</li>
      <li><code>TriggerR</code> will pass a reference to the object.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><code>TriggerPtr</code> is used when passing a pointer (smart or otherwise) to an object.</p>



    <h3>Using calls </h3>

    <p> Calls are wrappers for C++ function pointers which allow you to hide
    the difference between calling a method of a class and a normal function,
    and to add default arguments to the call that the code calling the
    function need not know about. </p>

    <p>When you setup a callback function, you can set default arguments. This
    is especially useful if the function or method you wish to call requires
    more information than the callback normally provides.  In this example,
    <code>Trigger()</code> provides the 3 arguments required for the callback
    function; however, because the first two get over-ridden by the
    <code>func()</code> call, only the 3rd one actually gets used, providing a
    default value of 30 for the 3rd argument of <code>callback()</code>.</p>

<pre>
#include "Ravl/Calls.hh"

bool callback(int &v1,double &v2,int &x) {
  // Do something....
  return true;
}

int myprog() {

  // Declare callback variable.
  CallFunc2C&lt;int,double&gt; func;  
  
  // Set up callback.
  // The first 2 arguments will be over-ridden by the subsequent func().
  // The 3rd argument provides a default 3rd argument for callback()
  func = Trigger(&amp;callback,10,20,30);

  // Some parameters...  
  int v1 = 0;
  double v2 = 1.2;
  
  // Call function.
  func(v1,v2);
  
}
</pre>
