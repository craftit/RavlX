    <p>Sometimes you want to make code thread-safe because it <em>might></em>
be used in multithreaded code.  But you don't want to use the
mechanisms in <a href="Ravl.API.OS.Threads.html">OS->Threads</a> because
your code is basically O/S-independent, & so you don't want to pull in
the OS library at this stage.  If that is the case, use these classes
/ functions instead.  If threading is subsequently used, these
functions will be transparently enabled when the RAVL threads library
<b>RavlThreads</b> is linked into a program.</p>

<p>
Id 0 is a general system lock. <br>
Id 1 is used for locking the random number generator. <br>
Id 2 is used for non-reentrant 'C' library calls. <br>
Id 3 is reserved for use in RavlLogic. <br></p>
