    <p>RAVL arrays provide a more flexible and user-friendly substitute for the
traditional C-style arrays.  RAVL arrays are dynamically allocated, and are
"big" objects - i.e. they are reference-counted (see <a
href="Ravl.Introduction.Reference_Counting.html">Reference Counting</a>).
</p>

<p>There are two types of array provided in RAVL: regular arrays and simple
arrays.  If you're not sure which to use, stick with the regular ones.</p>


<menu> 

<li><b>Regular arrays:</b> These have indices that can have any lower and upper
bound.  The templates are: <a href="../Class/RavlN.Array1dC.html">Array1dC</a>, <a href="../Class/RavlN.Array2dC.html">Array2dC</a>, ..., from which various 
templated varieties are derived. For faster iterating over arrays, the regular 
arrays also have some special iterator classes: <a href="../Class/RavlN.Array1dIterC.html">Array1dIterC</a>, <a href="../Class/RavlN.Array1dIter2C.html">Array1dIter2C</a>,
<a href="../Class/RavlN.Array2dIterC.html">Array2dIterC</a>, ...  See under the appropriate array type for more details.

<li><b>Simple arrays:</b> These have an index range from 0 to some positive
number.  They are somewhat faster than regular arrays when array-bound checking
is turned on.  The templates are: <a href="../Class/RavlN.SArray1dC.html">SArray1dC</a>,<a href="../Class/RavlN.SArray2dC.html">SArray2dC</a>, ..., from which various
templated varieties are derived.  For faster iterating over arrays, the simple
arrays also have some special iterator classes: <a href="../Class/RavlN.SArray1dIterC.html">SArray1dIterC</a>, <a href="../Class/RavlN.SArray1dIter2C.html">SArray1dIter2C</a>,
<a href="../Class/RavlN.SArray2dIterC.html">SArray2dIterC</a>,...  See under the appropriate array type for more details.
