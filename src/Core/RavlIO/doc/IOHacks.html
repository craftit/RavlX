    <p>You want to use the <code>Load()</code> / <code>Save()</code> mechanism
    (or corresponding streaming system) but it complains at run time?  The
    problem is that QMake doesn't know which library to link, as the decision
    about which actual function to use is not made until run time.  So you
    have to include the relevant library explicitly in <code>defs.mk</code>.
    But you don't know the library name - so what to do?  Sometimes the
    documentation will tell you, particularly if you are using image or video
    classes and files.  </p>

    <p>But for bog standard classes, there is often no help.  The library you need is in <code>$RAVL_INSTALL/lib/RAVL/linux/shared</code>  One way to identify it is as follows: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Run QLibs to get a partial list of libraries needed.</li>
      <li> Identify the name of the library that includes the class of interest.</li>
      <li> There is likely to be a library at the above path of the same name,
        but with "IO" added, that will fix your problem.  E.g. if QLibs
        indicates that the relevant library is <code>RavlMath</code>,
        <code>Load()</code> / <code>Save()</code> will need
        <code>RavlMathIO</code>.</li>
      <li> Add this library to your <code>PROGLIBS</code> entry in <code>defs.mk</code>.</li>
</ol>
