    <p>Requires library <code>RavlDPDisplay</code></p>
    <hr>
    

    <h2> Displaying images and image sequences using the "@X" virtual file</h2>

    <p>This library allows the IO mechanism to 'save' image data to the display.  The string "@X" is used in place of a file name:</p>
    <pre>  Save("@X", img);</pre>

    <p>"@X" is one of the <a href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.Virtual_Files.html">virtual files</a>.  For a complete example, see <a href="../../../examples/exDPWindow.cc">here</a>.  Use the middle mouse button and the mouse wheel to move and rescale the image in the window.</p>

    <p>It can also be used to display a sequence of images via the RAVL streaming mechanism.  Thus if you want to output a series of images to the display, the constructor might be invoked as:</p>
<pre>
  DPOPortC<ImageC<ByteRGBValueC> > outp;
  if(!OpenOSequence(outp,"@X")) {
    cerr << "Failed to open output '" << ofn << "'\n";
    return 1;
  }
</pre>
    <p>To give the window a label "Images", invoke it like this:</p>
    <pre>  Save("@X:Images", img);</pre>

    <p>If you would like to display several images in separate windows, use different labels: <code>@X:Image1</code>, <code>@X:Image2</code> etc.</p>


    <h2>Resetting the image coordinates</h2>

    <p>If you want to reset the coordinates of the display each time a new image is sent, use "@XR" in place of "@X".  This is useful if you are displaying a series of images with different coordinate systems.  For example you might be displaying a sequence of sub-images, each taken from a different part of the original image.</p>


    <h2>Adding graphical objects to images  using the "@XA" virtual file name</h2>

    <p> Normally repeated saves to the same window will replace its contents.
    However if you want to accumulate the results of processing in a window
    you can use <B>"@XA"</B>.  For example if you want to add some points:</p>
<pre>
  Save("@X:Images", img);
  Save("@XA:Images", arrayOfPoints);
</pre>

    <p>This is relevant if you want for example to add graphics to an image.
    See the <a href="../Application/exDPWindow.html">example</a> for more
    details.</p>

    <p>You can of course add graphical objects to the
    image object, using the <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Drawing.html">pixel-based
    drawing functions</a>.  The advantages to using the "@XA" virtual file
    approach are:</p><ul>

      <li><p>Since the objects are no longer part of the image itself, when
      you rescale the display (using the mouse wheel), the widths of the lines
      that render the objects remain at the same scale (2 screen pixels).
      I.e. they no longer become pixellated as you blow the image up.</p></li>

      <li><p>The objects can be placed with sub-pixel accuracy.  In this
      regard, it is worth noting that the coordinate system is subtly
      different.  For example if a point has integer coordinates, it will be
      placed at the top left-hand corner of the corresponding pixel.  The
      pixel-based drawing functions on the other hand are placed relative to
      the centre of the pixel.</p> </li>

    </ul>

    <p>On the other hand:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <p>Because the virtual file
    system was not designed with this application in mind, you do not have
    much control over the appearance of the objects.  For example colours are
    assigned in a fixed order (red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, yellow, and
    the rest in white).  If you want several
    objects plotted in the same colour, they have to be plotted in the same
    <code>Save()</code> call.  However the colours can be changed subsequently 
    in the display using the layer editor</p></li>

      <li><p>The only simple way to find out what kind of objects can be
      plotted (if on a Unix-type system) is to run: </p> 
        
        <pre>  $RAVL_INSTALL/bin/conv -lc | grep DPDisplay</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
