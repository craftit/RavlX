    <title>Optimiser classes II</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  This set of classes covers non-linear optimisation of a vector of parameters
  using a combination of multiple observations.
  Currently the supported algorithms are:
    <ul>
      <li> Levenberg-Marquardt least squares minimisation, with the added feature
        of allowing robust observations. There is a
        <a href="../../../html/levmarq.pdf">PDF document</a>
        describing the theory underlying this implementation of
        Levenberg-Marquardt.
        The LevenbergMarquardtC class implements a standard
        Levenberg-Marquardt damped least-squares iteration, given a
        state vector and a list of observations.
        There is an alternative Levenberg-Marquardt implementation in the
        <a href="Ravl.API.Pattern_Recognition.Optimisation.Implementation.html">Optimisation I</a> category.
      <li> RANSAC robust model fitting using randomised sampling.
        The RansacC class constitutes a generic implementation
        of RANSAC, with user-defined classes for sampling, fitting the
        model to a sample and evaluating model parameters.
    </ul>
    <p> There is also a <a href="../../../html/Optimisation.pdf">presentation on RANSAC and Levenberg-Marquardt</a>.</p>
    <p> The main principle embodied in the design of these classes is the need
      for separating the role of the four major classes of objects involved in
      optimisation:
  <ol>
    <li> A data item such as a point or a line, signifying a piece of data
         that should fit one or more models for the data, along with an
	 estimate for the uncertainty (covariance). ObsVectorC is the
	 base class for such data points, and can be used directly for
	 simple data items. Sub-classes of ObsVectorC deal
	 with more complex error models (usually robust models, see
	 ObsVectorBiGaussianC) and specific
	 types of data items, of which the 2D point pair is the only
	 current example (see ObsVectorPoint2dPairC and
	 ObsVectorBGPoint2dPairC). For specific data item types the most
	 useful, and probably only, added feature will be a specialised
	 constructor dealing with a particular data type.
    <li> The model to be fitted to the data. We organise the parameters of
         the model into a vector (the "state vector"), and the base class
	 StateVectorC encapsulates both the parameters and some standard
	 methods acting on them, such as adjusting a parameter or returning
	 the best estimate of the state vector. StateVectorC can be used
	 directly in simple cases, but best practice is to derive a class
	 specific to the model. This is often necessary in order to add
	 certain functionality into the model, for instance dealing with
	 redundant parameters (see the derived class StateVectorLine2dC).
	 It also provides stronger type checking in the observation sub-classes
	 (see below).
    <li> The observation model relating a data item to the model being fitted.
         This is the "glue" that pulls together the two class hierarchies
	 described above. The ObservationC base class encapsulates the
	 functional model for the relationship between a single data item
	 and the model being fitted. Sub-classes ObservationExplicitC and
	 ObservationImplicitC handle explicit and implicit functional models
	 respectively. You will need to derive a class from either
	 ObservationExplicitC or ObservationImplicit specific to the
	 functional model of your observations. If the functional model can
	 be put into explicit form, derive from ObservationExplicitC.
	 If the optimisation requires derivatives, you can optionally supply
	 a method to compute them; otherwise the default is to compute them
	 numerically.
    <li> The optimisation algorithm used to fit the model. Levenberg-Marquardt
         and RANSAC are the currently implemented algorithms,
	 and provide examples for building optimisation routines using the
	 above classes.
  </ol>
