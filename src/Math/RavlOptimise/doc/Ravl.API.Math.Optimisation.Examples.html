  These state vector models have been derived from the StateVectorC base class
  to represent specific models to be fitted by optimisation:
  <ol>
     <li> StateVectorLine2dC encapsulates a line on a plane;
     <li> StateVectorHomog2dC encapsulates a 3x3 homography representing a
          2D projective linear transformation between two planes;
     <li> StateVectorAffine2dC encapsulates a homography representing a
          2D affine linear transformation between two planes;
     <li> StateVectorRot3dC encapsulates a 3D rotation.
     <li> StateVectorQuadraticC encapsulates the parameters of a quadratic
          curve on a plane.
  </ol>
  Observations of data points used to fit these models then give rise to the
  following classes derived from one of ObservationExplicitC or
  ObservationImplicitC.
  <ul>
     <li> ObservationLine2dPointC for a 2D point to be fitted to a line on
          a plane.
     <li> ObservationHomog2dPointC and ObservationImpHomog2dPointC for a 2D
          point pair on planes related by a linear projective transformation
	  (homography). The two classes represent respectively the explicit
	  form with only the errors in the second plane modelled, and the
	  slightly more complex implicit form with both errors modelled.
     <li> ObservationQuadraticPointC and ObservationImpQuadraticPointC
          for a point on a quadratic curve. The explicit and implicit forms
	  are equivalent in this case, and the implicit form is used only
	  for testing purposes.
  </ul>
  The support classes ObsVectorPoint2dPairC and ObsVectorBGPoint2dPairC
  derived from ObsVectorC and ObsVectorBiGaussianC respectively
  allow you to construct pairs of 2D point observations. This class is used
  by the ObservationImpHomog2dPointC class, and should not be used directly by
  the user program, but it would be used to build new observation classes
  where 2D point pair observations are used with errors in both points,
  such as for fitting the epipolar geometry between two images.
  The other observation sub-classes use the ObsVectorC or ObsVectorBiGaussianC
  observation vector classes directly.
  <p>
  To implement RANSAC we need further classes that fit a state vector
  to a sample of observations, as sub-classes of FitToSampleC. The relevant
  classes are
  <ol>
     <li> FitLine2dPointsC fits a line to a sample of two or more points on
          a plane, represented by ObservationLine2dPointC objects.
     <li> FitHomog2dPointsC fits a homography to a sample of four or more
          point pairs on two planes, represented by either
	  ObservationHomog2dPointC or ObservationImpHomog2dPointC objects.
     <li> FitAffine2dPointsC fits a affine homography to a sample of four or more
          point pairs on two planes, represented by ObservationAffine2dPointC.
     <li> FitQuadraticPointsC fits a quadratic curve to 2D points, represented
          by ObservationQuadraticPointC objects.
  </ol>
