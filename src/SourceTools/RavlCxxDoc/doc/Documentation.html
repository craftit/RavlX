<!-- ******************* Page Summary (On LHS of Page)  ******************* -->
<P>
Code from a QMake project can be automatically documented using the <a
href="Ravl.API.Source_Tools.CxxDoc.html">CxxDoc</a> documentation system.  This
program runs through the entire source tree parsing all header files, plus any
other extra documentation files. <b>CxxDoc</b> creates a user-friendly HTML
reference manual for the code, complete with cross-referencing of type and
class names. </P>

<P><a NAME="UserAndDev"></a> It actually creates two documentation trees: "User" and
Develop".  User documentation is aimed at people who only want to use the
classes as they are and have no wish to know the details of how they work. As
such the user documentation only gives details of the public interface offered
by those classes which are intended for use in code employing the project
 library.  The 'develop' documentation on the other hand gives information about
all the elements of a class, including private member variables and functions.
This documentation is intended for people who wish to make changes to the library
to either extend to modify its functionality.
</P>
For a description of how to comment your code to get the most out of CxxDoc
see <a
