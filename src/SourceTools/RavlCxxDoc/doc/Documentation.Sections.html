      <p>This page describes the two basic ways extra documentation can be added
      to the automatically generated class pages. </p> 
      
      <h3>Adding extra documentation to the branch nodes</h3>
      
      <p>The "branch nodes" are those whose URL (like this page) end as:
      <code>.../Tree/xxx.html</code>.  These are the documentation pages that 
      exist in both
      <a href=Ravl.Documentation.html#UserAndDev>User and Develop form</a>. You
      may add additional information to the tree structure by:  </p><ul>
        <li><p>Create a normal HTML file (suffix <code>.html</code>) containing
        your additional documentation.  To the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML
        document add author and docentry lines: </p><code><pre>
    &lt;!--! author="Robert Crida" --&gt;
    &lt;!--! docentry="Ravl.Documentation.Branches" --&gt;</pre></code>
            <p>The docentry entry determines where the page goes in the
            documentation tree.</p></li>
        <li>Add an <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#EHT">EHT entry</a> to the
        <code>defs.mk</code> file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For documentation added in this way, CxxDoc will add: some standard
      links; links to the parents of the node, and a heading that is duplicated
      from the title in the HTML head. If an automatically-generated branch node
      page already exists at the same URL, its contents will be merged with the
      new documentation.</p>


      <h3>Stand-alone pages</h3>

      <p>If you have information that does not obviously fit in the class
      documentation tree, or is not HTML, it can be included as a stand-alone
      item. These files will be automatically copied to the html sub-directory
      (<code>$PROECT_OUT/share/doc/$PROJECT/html</code>). Despite the name of
      the directory, documentation added in this manner may be of any format
      (it can be .html, .pdf, .png or .txt, etc.). Unlike documentation produced
      using the above "EHT" option, no processing is performed on the source
      file (even if the source is a HTML document).</p>
      <p>To specify documentation to be included in this manner, it should be
      included as an <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#HTML">HTML item</a> in the
      <code>defs.mk</code> file. No links to the added documentation are
      automatically created by the CxxDoc documentation system, however, you
      may manually specify links from your other documentation source; just use
      the <code>../../../html/xxx.ext</code> path (where xxx.ext is the name of
      your extra documentation file).
