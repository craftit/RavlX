<!-- ******************* Page Summary (On LHS of Page)  ******************* -->
<P>Code is automatically documented using various specially-formatted comments 
embedded in the header files. For the impatient, an <A
HREF="#examplehh">example header file</A> highlighting the basic
CxxDoc comments and variables is shown below.
</P>

<P> Comments acknowledged by CxxDoc come in four varieties:  </P>

comments (lines beginning with "//") inside a class definition (or

form a detailed description of the class or member.</td></tr>

addition to short and detailed descriptions, special custom comment
types exist. The lines in these special comments start with "//!name:",
where "name" can have different values shown <A HREF="#specialcomments">below</A>. </td></tr>
<tr><td><B>//!&nbsp;name=</B>&lt;value&gt;</td><td><B>Global Variables</B>. Global variable
definitions have the format. "//!&nbsp;name = &lt;value&gt;". They must occur
OUTSIDE of any class declarations. There are three classes of
variables: required, optional and automatic. The different global
variables defined are described below. They apply to any items found
in the header file following the comment in which they are
declared.<br> Note that Variables have a space after the "!" whereas
Special Comment Types do not. Also Variables will persist after their
definition whereas Comments only exist at that point. </td></tr>
</TABLE>

<P> Please note that old C style comments between /* and */ are ignored when creating
the documentation. </P>

<P>
These comments are associated with declarations as follows.
</P>

<MENU>
<LI>
The last short description (if any) before the Class (or typedef or macro etc) declaration is taken as the Class description. All detailed descriptions after that will be associated with the class (or typedef or macro etc).

<LI>
All comments after each member declaration (functions, variables, typedefs 
etc) are taken as a description for that member of the class.

<LI>
The <I>const</I> after a constant member function must be separated from the
closing bracket by one space.

bugs by inserting it after the detailed description of the class. It
comes out in very big red font!</td></tr>

comment type is used to document the parameters in your member
functions. The name of the parameter comes straight after it followed
by a hyphen (-), and then the description of that parameter. To
continue the description on another line you just have another !param:
followed by a hyphen and then the rest of the description, as shown in
the <A HREF="#examplehh">example header file</A> below.</td></tr>

comment type is used to document the exceptions thrown by your member
functions. The name of the exception comes straight after it followed
by a hyphen (-), and then the description of that exception. To
continue the description on another line you use the same method as continuing !param:
descriptions. Just have another !exception: followed by a hyphen and then the rest of 
the description. See the !param: example shown in
the <A HREF="#examplehh">example header file</A> below.</td></tr>

and not for use in new code. Method's marked as deprectated may be removed
in future releases of the library.  </td></tr>

bugs associated to particular member functions. Insert it after the
detailed description of the member function.</td></tr>

<P>
This is a simple example showing the basic structure of a header file. It
includes the expected comments and where they should be placed. There is a
particular problem when using <I>forward references</I>. Placement of these are
critical.  In this example, the placement of the forward references
are correct. For more details see <A><A HREF="#forward">Forward
Referencing & Validity</A>.

<H3><A NAME="forward">Forward Referencing & Validity</A></H3>

There is a particular problem with documentation that is produced when
forward references are included in header files. The class description
must come AFTER all the forward references have been declared, i.e.
there should be nothing between the class description and the
definition of the class. A correct example was shown in the
<A HREF="#examplehh">Example Header File</A>
section.
