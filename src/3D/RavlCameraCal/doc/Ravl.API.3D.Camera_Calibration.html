    Routines for modelling the way in which a camera maps 3D world points into
    2D image points. <a href="../Class/Ravl3DN.PinholeCamera0C.html">PinholeCamera0C</a> is 
    the simplest pinhole camera model, with no modelling of lens distortion.

    <p>In progress are full camera calibration libraries to compute 
       the camera models from images, with first and second order lens
       distortion modelling.
