    <p>RAVL includes a comprehensive mechanism for reading and writing objects
    from and to files in a uniform and transparent fashion.  It is based
    around two global functions: <code>Load</code> and <code>Save</code>.  In
    particular, there is a set of routines to handle a variety of image file
    formats, together with the ability to convert between several different
    pixel representations.  For sequences of images, there is a <a
    href="Ravl.API.Images.Video.html"> separate mechanism</a>.</p>
    
    <p> The generic load/save mechanism is described in <a
    href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.html">Ravl.API.Core.IO</a>.  In order to invoke the
    libraries specific to image I/O, you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> insert this header file:
	<pre>
#include "Ravl/IO.hh"
	</pre></li>
      
      <li> add the <b><code>RavlImageIO</code></b> library in the <code>defs.mk</code>:
	<pre>
PROGLIBS = RavlImageIO ....
	</pre>
    </ul>
    
    <p> The generic load/save call can then be used in the <a
    href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.html">usual way</a>.  For an example of how to
    use the system with images see <a
    href="../../../examples/exImgIO.cc">exImgIO.cc</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="FORMATS">Supported formats</a></h3>  

    <p>At the time of writing, these are the currently supported formats. Supported natively
    in RAVL are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>pgm</b> Grey scale images.</li>
      <li><b>ppm</b> RGB colour images.</li>
      <li><b>pbm</b> Bit image</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you also link the <b><code>RavlExtImgIO</code></b> library, which in turn links to various open source libraries, you get (in addition to various video formats):</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>jpeg</b> Lossy compressed images. Colour and grey scale. (Supports sequences stored in a single file.)</li>
      <li><b>png</b> Lossless compressed images. Colour and grey scale.</li>
      <li><b>tiff</b> Lossless compressed images.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <p> You can also use the <code>conv</code> tool to find what file formats
    (and file conversions) are available, with the following options:</p>
      
    <dl>
      <dt><code>-lf</code> - list all known file formats</dt>
      <dt><code>-lc</code> - list all known conversions</dt>
      <dt><code>-lt</code> - list all known classes (?)</dt>
    </dl>
    <p> This command should list all the "interesting" file formats:</p>
    <pre>conv -lf | grep -v "\&lt;stream\&gt;" | grep -v "\&lt;abs\&gt;"</pre>

    <h3>Virtual files</h3>
	
    <p>If you want to pop up an image on the screen instead of writing
    to a file, or if you want to read an image directly from a camera,
    use the <a href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.Virtual_Files.html">virtual file
    system</a>.</p>

    <h3>Creating image converters</h3>
	
    <p>If you wish to load and save your own image type as
    <code>ppm</code>, <code>pgm</code> or any other file format that
    is already supported, and the particular conversion you want is
    not currently available, it is straightforward to add one to the
    collection (currently in
    <code>Ravl/Image/ImageIO/ImgTypeCnv.cc)</code>.  Following is an
    example for converting a byte image into a double image.  For more
    information on writing converters see <a
    href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.html">Ravl.API.Core.IO</a></p>


	<pre>
ImageC&lt RealT&gt DPConvImageC<ByteT>T2RealImageCT(const ImageC&lt ByteT&gt &dat)  
{ 
  ImageC&lt RealT&gt ret(dat.Rectangle());
  for(Array2dIter2C&lt RealT,ByteT&gt it(ret,dat);it;it++) 
    it.Data1() = (RealT) it.Data2();
  return ret;
}

DP_REGISTER_CONVERSION(ImageC<ByteT>T2RealImageCT, 1);
    </pre>

    <p>The argument in the function call indicates (as a ratio of the
	number of bytes in the respective pixels) the amount of
	information lost in the conversion.  In this example, no
	information is lost, so the ratio is 1.  For double to char
	conversion, the ratio would be 8.</p>
