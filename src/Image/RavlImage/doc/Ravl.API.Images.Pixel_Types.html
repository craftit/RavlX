    <p>The pixel classes are grouped into subtopics according to the colour
    space used.  The relevant image conversion functions are included in each
    group, as well as in a <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Converters.html">complete
    list</a>.  Subtopics also contain conversions between the subtopic colour
    space and colour spaces further up the list.</p>

    <p>Note that YUV colour components are a linear combination of
    RGB components; hence the U and V components <i>do</i> contain luminance
    information.  (E.g. doubling R, G and B components will, after conversion
    to YUV, double the U and V components, even though the chromaticity has
    not changed.)  If you need a representation that separates luminance and
    chromaticity completely, use the HSV classes.</p>

    <p>There is much confusion about the difference between YUV and YCbCr, and
    the term YUV is frequently used when YCbCr is meant:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The colour spaces for YUV and YCbCr are different; hence within
      RAVL, the difference is manifested in the matrix values used to convert
      between YUV (or YCbCr) and RGB.  We have introduced separate pixel
      classes for each to help people produce the correct colour rendering of
      their images. </li>

      <li>The YUV colour space traditionally used by the image processing
      community is based on the colour space used in analogue composite colour
      television signals, but ignoring the offset of the black level.</li>

      <li> YCbCr pixels have a black offset of 16 grey levels.  These classes
      are relevant in the context of ITU Rec. 601 digital video sources (or
      high-def equivalents), such as the DVS digital video acquistion and
      playback cards.  Hence use YCbCr only if you are operating directly on
      these sources or files grabbed directly from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The YPbPr classes are intended for a simulation of the analogue composite video format.</p>
