    <title>YPbPr "analogue" composite video pixel types</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>YPbPr refers to a format of analogue composite signals, and as such does not really have a place in a digital image processing library.  It has been included for completeness, and is instantiated only as a "float" pixel type, being the nearest digital "analogue" to an analogue signal.</p>
