    <p> The following classes implement video file handling built into RAVL.
    Normally you don't use them directly, but via the Sequence IO mechanism
    described <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Video.html">here</a>. </p>

    <p>See the "Subtopics" (if any) for other video formats.  These will be
    mainly from the <a href="Ravl.Introduction.Contrib.html"> contrib</a> set;
    however anything that appears in the Subtopics has been installed on the
    system already.</p>

    <p>Writing your own video file handler: this is no different from the general stream file I/O.  Some implementation details <a href="Ravl.API.Core.IO.html#writingyourown">here</a>.</p>
    <p> Also see the <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Video.html"> video section </a> for a list of common attributes. </p>
