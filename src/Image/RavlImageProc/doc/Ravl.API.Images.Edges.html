    <p>The edges described here are the result of an edge detection process, i.e. they typically represent points of maximum intensity gradient.  Ultimately they are expressed as strings of pixels.   This is in contrast to the region boundary representation in <a href="Ravl.API.Images.Boundaries.html">Boundaries</a></p>

    <p>The basic class needed for edge detection is <a href="../Class/RavlImageN.EdgeDetectC.html">EdgeDetectC</a>.</p>
