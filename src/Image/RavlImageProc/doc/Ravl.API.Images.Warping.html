    <p>Some points to note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The transform used by the warper actually computes points in the
      reference image by transforming pixel coordinates from the warped image.
      Hence if the warper is constructed on a transform with for example a
      scale of 2 and positive rotation, the warped image will be &frac12; of
      the size of the reference image and rotated negatively with respect to
      it.</p></li> 
      
      <li><p>There are two possible coordinate systems to use when warping an
      image:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The coordinate system is at the top left-hand corner of pixel
          (0,0).  Thus a rotation of +90&deg; will map pixel (0,0) to pixel
          (-1,0).</li>
          <li>The coordinate system is at the centre of pixel (0,0), so that a
          rotation of +90&deg; will map pixel (0,0) to itself.  </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The default behaviour is the former, to preserve backwards
        compatibility.  Use the <code>SetMidPixelCorrection()</code> method
        with <code>correction = false</code> to get the latter behaviour.</p> </li>

      <li>The default interpolation used is bilinear.  This can be changed
      using suitable definitions of MixerT and SampleT in constructor and
      template of the relevant warper.</li>
    </ul>

  // <p>By default, the coordinate system for the input image is considered to be the top left-hand corner of pixel [0][0].  Thus a rotation of +90&deg; will map position (0,0) to (-1,0).  This behaviour is the default one for backwards compatibility.</p>  

  // <p>Use <code>SetMidPixelCorrection(false)</code> to move the coordinate system to the centre of pixel [0][0], so that a rotation of +90&deg; will map position (0,0) to itself.</p>
