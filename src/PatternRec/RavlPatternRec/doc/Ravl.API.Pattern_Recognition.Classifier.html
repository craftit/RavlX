  <body>
    These classifiers are designed to classify numerical data, assigning
a label to a feature vector. Each classifier is derived from the generic ClassifierC class. 

<br><br>
   Many classifiers have an associated <a href="Ravl.API.Pattern_Recognition.Classifier.DesignClassifier.html"> DesignClassifier </a> class which is used to initialize the classifier. 
Where appropriate, these are described in the classifier documentation.
